## Wizard figth : The project

We realize this project with comrads during a class called How To Make Almost Everything. The purpuse of this project was to make a game, similar to a gameboy from scratch using homemade ESP32 Dev Kit. All of this with a twist ! The game had to be playable at two players on two separated consoles connected by wifi (which is suported in the ESP32 chips).

As you may see we sold a custom shield on a custom ESP32 devkit me made in an earlier class. 

Also, we modelised and 3d printed the casing and the buttons around it.

## The game

In this game, you incarne a wizard who encounters a strange portal which shots dangerous spells at him ! 
So the only solution is to fight back ! With your four spells, you must act quick to overcome this dangerous trap. 

In practise, the two gameboys are linked, and whatever a player send throught his portal comes out of the other player's. 
So the purpuse is to act faster that the person you fight against.
